		<strong>Let me introduce myself:</strong><br>
		My name is Dr. Jebidiah Haberdash Von SmarmSnoot. I am a cataloger, researcher and collector of weird and exotic creatures. I live in a remote area just teeming with interesting animals. I have found many a creature <em> in my own backyard. </em> <br><br>

		<h3 id="boggle_brunt">Boggle Brunt</h3>
		<img src="http://d5wt70d4gnm1t.cloudfront.net/media/a-s/articles/1549-419200057296/7-mythical-beasts-from-across-art-history-900x450-c.jpg" width="500" alt="Picture of a Boggle Brunt">
		<p>This strange creature was eating a bagel on my porch last Tuesday, and it didn't even want butter or cream cheese... how bizarre! <a href="https://www.cupertinosbagels.com" target="_blank"> Click here if this makes you hungry for a bagel.</a></p><br>

		<h3 id="jangle_flanger">Jangle Flanger </h3><h6>Large, roundish thing below</h6>
		<img src="https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/54095e10823485.560ebdb964f7c.jpg" width="500" alt="Picture of a Jangle Flanger">
		<p> Surprisingly, the Jangle Flanger is a fish-like being with a humanoid face that mysteriously floats around on land. I snapped a picture of the creature with his friend, Evil Cow, and somehow an angel appeared. Go figure!</p>

		<h3 id="fluff_bandit">Fluff Bandit</h3>
		<img src="https://img00.deviantart.net/5a28/i/2011/212/0/b/magic_squirrel_ride_by_okitaru369-d42b6di.jpg" width="500" alt="Picture of a Fluff Bandit">
		<p>While these creatures may appear cute, they are fierce and wildly clever. I've been stabbed more than a few times by their razor sharp horns. What's that? A chipmunk, you say? Never heard of 'em... I'll make a note to track one down someday...</p>

		<h3 id="jeffrey">The Beast Known as... Jeffrey</h3>
		<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/59/3e/20/593e20161e23d281567e98132faa01b6.jpg" width="500" alt="Picture of Jeffrey">
		<p>The most terrifying, madness-inducing daemon of all. There is no bounds to its wanton destruction and bloodlust. I've never properly seen the creature myself... only the hateful, glowing orbs of its eyes glaring at me through the pitch black night. Barring any other information on the beast, I've deemed it a suitable horrifying name: Jeffrey. <em> Damn you, Jeffrey! Stop eating my petunias! </em><br><br>
